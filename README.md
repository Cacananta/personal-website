# Personal Portfolio v1.0

This is my first attempt at building a personal portfolio page. I wanted to show that I have an eye for design as well as learn new CSS techniques in the process. It was a ton of fun learning best practice for page flows, incorporating media queries to make the interface friendly across all devices, and it was great to reach back into my jQuery knowledge and build a parallax effect. I used ejs for the templating on my contact page (which is enabled through Twilio). There are links to my most recent projects hosted on Heroku.
